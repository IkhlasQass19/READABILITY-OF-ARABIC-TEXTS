# Arabic Text Readability Evaluation with SVM

This project aims to assess the readability of Arabic texts using Support Vector Machines (SVM). 

## Features Utilized

- **SL1**: Number of sentences in a text
- **WL1**: Number of words in a text
- **WL4**: Number of stems in a text
- **WL5**: Number of characters in a text
- **AMb1**: Number of ambiguous lemmas
- **VL1**: Number of distinct lemmas
- **VL2**: Number of frequent lemmas

These features were extracted from the provided text files and were crucial in determining the readability level of Arabic texts.

## SVM Model

We trained an SVM model using these features to predict the readability level of Arabic texts accurately. SVM is chosen due to its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to generalize well.

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your Arabic text data in the same format as the provided dataset.
2. Extract the features using the provided methods or implement your feature extraction pipeline.
3. Train the SVM model using the extracted features.
4. Evaluate the model's performance and adjust as necessary.

## Applications

This project holds significant implications in various fields such as education, communication, and natural language processing. By accurately assessing the readability of Arabic texts, it can improve accessibility and comprehension in these domains.
